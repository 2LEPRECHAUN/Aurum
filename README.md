#Aurum
Aurum is a resource pack based on Summerfields. In fact there are only modifications of the original textures, some more, some less. The proposal is to improve the decorative and constructive look.

Notes 
-----
        
* LithiumSound has created SummerFields. 
* CuddleWoozle continued the texture pack. 
* Currently external contributions are helping the package to stay updated.

Notes Aurum
-----------

* I give all credit to the original texture pack, SummerFields; [Forum] (http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/424521-32x32-132-pre12w37a-summerfields-r29a-is-out-ready-for-the-latest-snapshot-14092012-950k-download/) - [Site] (http://cuddlewoozle.github.io/SummerFields).
* Modification of the sandstone is based on the original texture (Netherrack) from [Assassini Costruttori] (http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/268340-32x13-assassini-costruttori-discontinued/).
* Modification of the trapdoor is based on the original texture (Trapdoor-ExtremeHills) from [Conquest] (http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1452033-174-32x32-conquest-wip-weekly-updates/).
* Modification of the Villagers and the Witch are based on the texture remake by Lipki - [Enigma] (http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2614304-32x-enigma/).
